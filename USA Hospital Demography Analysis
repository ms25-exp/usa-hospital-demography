- Compared **insurance providers** based on **average payment** across medical conditions
- Used **DAX** measures with `CALCULATE`, `SWITCH`, and `SUMX` for advanced insights
- Developed a clean, interactive **Power BI report** showcasing patient and hospital insights

## Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI**
- **DAX**
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**
- **Card Visuals, Bar Charts, Slicers, and Filters**

## ðŸ§  Key Insights
